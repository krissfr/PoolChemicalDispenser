# PoolChemicalDispenser
a pool chemical dispenser with esphome and MKS DLC32 board

For this projet, you need :
- a MKS DLC32 board
- 3 stepper drivers (i use a4988)
- 1 128x64 SSD1309 SPI Oled display
- 1 rotary encoder with switch

For a unkown reason, i have to add a small diode (i use 1n4148) to lower a bit the 5v input voltage of the SSD1309 oled display.
